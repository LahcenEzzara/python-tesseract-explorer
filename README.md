# Python Explorer - A Simple Starting Template

This repository contains a simple Python script that outputs the Zen of Python, a set of guiding principles for writing Pythonic code. This can be used as a starting point for exploring Python or as a lightweight template for new projects.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LahcenEzzara/python-explorer.git
   cd python-explorer
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The script will display the Zen of Python in your terminal.

## Example Output

When you run the script, you'll see:

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## Why Use This?

- **Simplicity**: The script demonstrates how to run a Python program and interact with core Python features.
- **The Zen of Python**: These principles serve as an excellent introduction to Python's philosophy and best practices.
